What is a Row in Numpy?
>> A row is a horizontal line of elements.
>> Left to Right = Row.

[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]

>> Row 0 = [1, 2, 3]
>> Row 1 = [4, 5, 6]


What is a Column in Numpy?
>> A column is a vertical line of elements.
>> Top to Bottom = Column.

>> Column 0 = [1, 4]
>> Column 1 = [2, 5]
>> Column 2 = [3, 6]

What is axis in Numpy?
>> In numpy, axis tells numpy in which direction it should do an operation (like sum, mean, etc.)

Axis	        Direction	                          Meaning
0	         Top to Bottom (↓)	        Operate column-wise (down the rows)
1	         Left to Right (→)	        Operate row-wise (across the columns)


Super simple tip to remember:

Axis	           Works on	            How to remember?
0	               Columns	        Think top to bottom (⬇️)
1	               Rows	            Think left to right (➡️)
